Saint Ignatius of Antioch, also known as Theophorus, was a prominent early
Christian leader and the third bishop of Antioch. Born in Syria around 35-50 AD,
he is believed to have been a disciple of the Apostle John. Tradition holds that
he was one of the children Jesus blessed.

Ignatius led the church in Antioch for approximately 40 years. During the
persecution under Emperor Trajan, he was arrested and condemned to death in
Rome. It was on his journey to Rome that he wrote seven influential letters that
have survived to this day. These letters are a significant source of early
Christian theology, covering topics such as ecclesiology, the sacraments, the
role of bishops, and the divinity of Christ. He is also credited with the first
known use of the term "Catholic Church" to describe the universal church.

Ignatius was martyred in the Roman Colosseum, where he was thrown to wild
beasts. He famously wrote, "I am the wheat of the Lord; may I be ground by the
teeth of the beasts to become the immaculate bread of Christ." His feast day is
observed on October 17 in Western Christianity and December 20 in Eastern
Christianity.
