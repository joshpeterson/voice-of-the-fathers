## Introduction

Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the holy Church which is at Tralles,
beloved by God the Father, and Jesus Christ, elect, and worthy of God,
possessing peace through the flesh and Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is our hope,
in His passion by the cross and death, and in His resurrection, which also I
salute in its fullness, and in the apostolic character, and wish abundance of
happiness.

## Chapter 1 - Acknowledgment of their excellence

I know that you possess a blameless and sincere mind in patience, and that not
only for present use, but as a permanent possession, as Polybius your bishop has
shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of God the Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ, His Son, with the co-operation of the Spirit, and so sympathized
in the joy which I, who am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your
whole multitude in Him. Having therefore received through him the testimony of
your good-will according to God, I gloried to find that you were the followers
of Jesus Christ the Saviour.

## Chapter 2 - Subject to the bishop, etc.

Be you subject to the bishop as to the Lord, for “he watches for your souls, as
one that shall give account to God.” Wherefore also, you appear to me to live
not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in
order that, by believing in His death, you may by baptism be made partakers of
His resurrection. It is therefore necessary, whatsoever things you do, to do
nothing without the bishop. And be you subject also to the presbytery, as to the
apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be
found in Him. It behoves you also, in every way, to please the deacons, who are
ministers of the mysteries of Christ Jesus; for they are not ministers of meat
and drink, but servants of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to
avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would a burning fire. Let
them, then, prove themselves to be such.

## Chapter 3 - Honour the deacons, etc.

And do you reverence them as Christ Jesus, of whose place they are the keepers,
even as the bishop is the representative of the Father of all things, and the
presbyters are the Sanhedrin of God, and assembly of the apostles of Christ.
Apart from these there is no elect Church, no congregation of holy ones, no
assembly of saints. I am persuaded that you also are of this opinion. For I have
received the manifestation of your love, and still have it with me, in your
bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his meekness of itself
a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence. Loving you as I do, I
avoid writing in any severer strain to you, that I may not seem harsh to any, or
wanting in tenderness. I am indeed bound for the sake of Christ, but I am not
yet worthy of Christ. But when I am perfected, perhaps I shall then become so. I
do not issue orders like an apostle.

## Chapter 4 - I have need of humility

But I measure myself, that I may not perish through boasting: but it is good to
glory in the Lord. And even though I were established in things pertaining to
God, yet then would it befit me to be the more fearful, and not give heed to
those that vainly puff me up. For those that commend me scourge me. I do indeed
desire to suffer, but I know not if I be worthy to do so. For the envy of the
wicked one is not visible to many, but it wars against me. I therefore have need
of meekness, by which the devil, the prince of this world, is brought to nought.

## Chapter 5 - I will not teach you profound doctrines

For might not I write to you things more full of mystery? But I fear to do so,
lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes in Christ. Pardon me in
this respect, lest, as not being able to receive their weighty import, you
should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am bound for Christ, and am
able to understand heavenly things, the angelic orders, and the different sorts
of angels and hosts, the distinctions between powers and dominions, and the
diversities between thrones and authorities, the mightiness of the Æons, and the
pre-eminence of the cherubim and seraphim, the sublimity of the spirit, the
kingdom of the Lord, and above all, the incomparable majesty of Almighty
God—though I am acquainted with these things, yet am I not therefore by any
means perfect; nor am I such a disciple as Paul or Peter. For many things are
yet wanting to me, that I may not fall short of God.

## Chapter 6 - Abstain from the poison of heretics

I therefore, yet not I, out the love of Jesus Christ, “entreat you that you all
speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be
perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.” For there
are some vain talkers and deceivers, not Christians, but Christ-betrayers,
bearing about the name of Christ in deceit, and “corrupting the word” of the
Gospel; while they intermix the poison of their deceit with their persuasive
talk, as if they mingled aconite with sweet wine, that so he who drinks, being
deceived in his taste by the very great sweetness of the draught, may
incautiously meet with his death. One of the ancients gives us this advice, “Let
no man be called good who mixes good with evil.” For they speak of Christ, not
that they may preach Christ, but that they may reject Christ; and they speak of
the law, not that they may establish the law, but that they may proclaim things
contrary to it. For they alienate Christ from the Father, and the law from
Christ. They also calumniate His being born of the Virgin; they are ashamed of
His cross; they deny His passion; and they do not believe His resurrection. They
introduce God as a Being unknown; they suppose Christ to be unbegotten; and as
to the Spirit, they do not admit that He exists. Some of them say that the Son
is a mere man, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but the same
person, and that the creation is the work of God, not by Christ, but by some
other strange power.

## Chapter 7 - The same continued

Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons, that you admit not of a snare
for your own souls. And act so that your life shall be without offence to all
men, lest you become as “a snare upon a watch-tower, and as a net which is
spread out.” For “he that does not heal himself in his own works, is the brother
of him that destroys himself.” If, therefore, you also put away conceit,
arrogance, disdain, and haughtiness, it will be your privilege to be inseparably
united to God, for “He is nigh unto those that fear Him.” And says He, “Upon
whom will I look, but upon him that is humble and quiet, and that trembles at my
words?” And do you also reverence your bishop as Christ Himself, according as
the blessed apostles have enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure,
wherefore also he is obedient to the bishop and presbyters: but he that is
without is one that does anything apart from the bishop, the presbyters, and the
deacons. Such a person is defiled in his conscience, and is worse than an
infidel. For what is the bishop but one who beyond all others possesses all
power and authority, so far as it is possible for a man to possess it, who
according to his ability has been made an imitator of the Christ of God? And
what is the presbytery but a sacred assembly, the counsellors and assessors of
the bishop? And what are the deacons but imitators of the angelic powers,
fulfilling a pure and blameless ministry unto him, as the holy Stephen did to
the blessed James, Timothy and Linus to Paul, Anencletus and Clement to Peter?
He, therefore, that will not yield obedience to such, must needs be one utterly
without God, an impious man who despises Christ, and depreciates His
appointments.

## Chapter 8 - Be on your guard against the snares of the devil

Now I write these things unto you, not that I know there are any such persons
among you; nay, indeed I hope that God will never permit any such report to
reach my ears, He “who spared not His Son for the sake of His holy Church.” But
foreseeing the snares of the wicked one, I arm you beforehand by my admonitions,
as my beloved and faithful children in Christ, furnishing you with the means of
protection against the deadly disease of unruly men, by which do you flee from
the disease referred to by the good-will of Christ our Lord. Do you therefore,
clothing yourselves with meekness, become the imitators of His sufferings, and
of His love, wherewith He loved us when He gave Himself a ransom for us, that He
might cleanse us by His blood from our old ungodliness, and bestow life on us
when we were almost on the point of perishing through the depravity that was in
us. Let no one of you, therefore, cherish any grudge against his neighbour. For
says our Lord, “Forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you.” Give no occasion to
the Gentiles, lest “by means of a few foolish men the word and doctrine of
Christ be blasphemed.” For says the prophet, as in the person of God, “Woe to
him by whom my name is blasphemed among the Gentiles.”

## Chapter 9 - Reference to the history of Christ

Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who
was truly begotten of God and of the Virgin, but not after the same manner. For
indeed God and man are not the same. He truly assumed a body; for “the Word was
made flesh,” and lived upon earth without sin. For says He, “Which of you
convicteth me of sin?” He did in reality both eat and drink. He was crucified
and died under Pontius Pilate. He really, and not merely in appearance, was
crucified, and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under
the earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are possessed of incorporeal
natures; by those on earth, the Jews and Romans, and such persons as were
present at that time when the Lord was crucified; and by those under the earth,
the multitude that arose along with the Lord. For says the Scripture, “Many
bodies of the saints that slept arose,” their graves being opened. He descended,
indeed, into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a multitude; and rent
asunder that means of separation which had existed from the beginning of the
world, and cast down its partition-wall. He also rose again in three days, the
Father raising Him up; and after spending forty days with the apostles, He was
received up to the Father, and “sat down at His right hand, expecting till His
enemies are placed under His feet.” On the day of the preparation, then, at the
third hour, He received the sentence from Pilate, the Father permitting that to
happen; at the sixth hour He was crucified; at the ninth hour He gave up the
ghost; and before sunset He was buried. During the Sabbath He continued under
the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of Arimathæa had laid Him. At the dawning
of the Lord’s day He arose from the dead, according to what was spoken by
Himself, “As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so
shall the Son of man also be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.” The day of the preparation, then, comprises the passion; the Sabbath
embraces the burial; the Lord’s Day contains the resurrection.

## Chapter 10 - The reality of Christ's passion

But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, He became
man in appearance only, that He did not in reality take unto Him a body, that He
died in appearance merely, and did not in very deed suffer, then for what reason
am I now in bonds, and long to be exposed to the wild beasts? In such a case, I
die in vain, and am guilty of falsehood against the cross of the Lord. Then also
does the prophet in vain declare, “They shall look on Him whom they have
pierced, and mourn over themselves as over one beloved.” These men, therefore,
are not less unbelievers than were those that crucified Him. But as for me, I do
not place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in reality. For
that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly
conceive a body which had God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of
the Virgin, having clothed Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He
who forms all men in the womb, was Himself really in the womb, and made for
Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but without any intercourse of man. He
was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual period of time; and was
really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished with milk, and partook
of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when He had lived among men for
thirty years, He was baptized by John, really and not in appearance; and when He
had preached the Gospel three years, and done signs and wonders, He who was
Himself the Judge was judged by the Jews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the
governor; was scourged, was smitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown
of thorns and a purple robe; He was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and
not in appearance, not in imagination, not in deceit. He really died, and was
buried, and rose from the dead, even as He prayed in a certain place, saying,
“But do Thou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall recompense them.” And the
Father, who always hears Him, answered and said, “Arise, O God, and judge the
earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine inheritance.” The
Father, therefore, who raised Him up, will also raise us up through Him, apart
from whom no one will attain to true life. For says He, “I am the life; he that
believes in me, even though he die, shall live: and every one that lives and
believes in me, even though he die, shall live for ever.” Do you therefore flee
from these ungodly heresies; for they are the inventions of the devil, that
serpent who was the author of evil, and who by means of the woman deceived Adam,
the father of our race.

## Chapter 11 - Avoid the deadly errors of the Docetæ

Do you also avoid those wicked offshoots of his, Simon his firstborn son, and
Menander, and Basilides, and all his wicked mob of followers, the worshippers of
a man, whom also the prophet Jeremiah pronounces accursed. Flee also the impure
Nicolaitanes, falsely so called, who are lovers of pleasure, and given to
calumnious speeches. Avoid also the children of the evil one, Theodotus and
Cleobulus, who produce death-bearing fruit, whereof if any one tastes, he
instantly dies, and that not a mere temporary death, but one that shall endure
for ever. These men are not the planting of the Father, but are an accursed
brood. And says the Lord, “Let every plant which my heavenly Father has not
planted be rooted up.” For if they had been branches of the Father, they would
not have been “enemies of the cross of Christ,” but rather of those who “killed
the Lord of glory.” But now, by denying the cross, and being ashamed of the
passion, they cover the transgression of the Jews, those fighters against God,
those murderers of the Lord; for it were too little to style them merely
murderers of the prophets. But Christ invites you to share in His immortality,
by His passion and resurrection, inasmuch as you are His members.

## Chapter 12 - Continue in unity and love

I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me,
whose rulers have refreshed me in every respect, both in the flesh and in the
spirit. My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of Jesus Christ
(praying that I may attain to God), exhort you. Continue in harmony among
yourselves, and in supplication; for it becomes every one of you, and especially
the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father, and to the
honour of Jesus Christ and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me,
that I may not, by having thus written, be a testimony against you. And do you
also pray for me, who have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that
I may be thought worthy to attain the lot for which I am now designed, and that
I may not be found reprobate.

## Chapter 13 - Conclusion

The love of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember our Church which
is in Syria, from which I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being the
last of those of that place. Fare you well in the Lord Jesus Christ, while you
continue subject to the bishop, and in like manner to the presbyters and to the
deacons. And do you, every man, love one another with an undivided heart. My
spirit salutes you, not only now, but also when I shall have attained to God;
for I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father of Jesus Christ is faithful to
fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may we be found without spot. May I
have joy of you in the Lord.
