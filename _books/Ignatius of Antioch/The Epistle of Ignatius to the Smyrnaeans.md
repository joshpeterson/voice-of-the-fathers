## Introduction

Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God the Father, and
our Lord Jesus Christ, which is at Smyrna, in Asia, which has obtained mercy in
every gift, and is adorned with faith and love, and is wanting in no gift, but
is full of God, and is fruitful in all holiness, I salute in the blood of Jesus
Christ, who is our eternal and enduring joy, especially if [men] are in unity
with the bishop, and the presbyters, who are with him, and the deacons, who are
appointed according to the mind of Jesus Christ, whom He has established in
their several positions, after His own will, and has firmly settled them by His
Holy Spirit.

## Chapter 1 - Exhortations to unity

I know that you possess a blameless and sincere mind in patience, and that not
only in present circumstances, but that you have been always of the same
disposition, as is shown by your bishop, Polybius, who has come by the will of
God and Jesus Christ to Smyrna, and has so largely shared in my joy in my bonds
for Jesus Christ, that I beheld your whole multitude in him. Receiving,
therefore, your good-will in him, I have begun to think of you as I do of
myself, and to love you as my own soul. For I know that you are not puffed up,
but are humble, and that you are not ashamed to confess your faith in Christ,
but are ready to suffer for His name. I exhort you, therefore, to be of one
mind, and to be subject to the bishop, as to the grace of God, and to the
presbytery, as to the law of Jesus Christ, and to the deacons, as to the
ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ. For they are not the ministers of
meat and drink, but of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid
all grounds of accusation against them, as they would do fire.

## Chapter 2 - Do nothing without the bishop

I exhort you to do nothing without the bishop, but to be subject also to the
presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we
live, we shall be found in Him. It is meet also that the deacons, the ministers
of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in all things be pleasing to all. For
they are not the ministers of meat and drink, but of the Church of God. They are
bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would
do fire.

## Chapter 3 - Avoid schism

I exhort you to avoid schism, and to be united to the bishop, and to those that
preside over you, for a type and evidence of your immortality. For as many as
are of God and of Jesus Christ are with the bishop; and as many as shall repent
and return to the unity of the Church, these also shall be of God, that they may
live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him
that makes a schism, he inherits not the kingdom of God. If any man walks
according to a strange opinion, he has no fellowship with the passion of Christ.

## Chapter 4 - Have but one Eucharist

Take heed, then, to have but one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and one cup to [show forth] the unity of His blood; one altar, as
there is one bishop, with the presbytery, and deacons, my fellow-servants, that
whatsoever you do, you may do it according to [the will of] God.

## Chapter 5 - The false teachers confuted

My brethren, I am full of love towards you, and I rejoice greatly in your faith,
and in your love, and in your patience, and in your long-suffering. For I know
that you are not puffed up, but are humble, and that you are not ashamed to
confess your faith in Christ, but are ready to suffer for His name. I exhort
you, therefore, to be of one mind, and to be subject to the bishop, as to the
grace of God, and to the presbytery, as to the law of Jesus Christ, and to the
deacons, as to the ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ. For they are not
the ministers of meat and drink, but of the Church of God. They are bound,
therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would do
fire.

## Chapter 6 - Do not listen to Judaizers

If any one preaches to you Judaism, do not listen to him. For it is better to
hear Christianity from a man who is circumcised, than Judaism from one
uncircumcised. But if either of them do not speak concerning Jesus Christ, they
are to me but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, where only the bones of
men are buried. Flee therefore the wicked arts and snares of the prince of this
world, lest at any time being overcome by his cunning, you grow weak in your
love. But be you all of one and the same mind, and be united in faith, and in
Jesus Christ, our God.

## Chapter 7 - I have exhorted you to unity

I have exhorted you to unity, and to be subject to the bishop, and to the
presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we
live, we shall be found in Him. It is meet also that the deacons, the ministers
of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in all things be pleasing to all. For
they are not the ministers of meat and drink, but of the Church of God. They are
bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would
do fire.

## Chapter 8 - The Old Testament saints were Christians

The Old Testament saints were Christians, for they hoped in Christ. Wherefore
also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the
unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ
His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence, and who in
all things pleased Him that sent Him.

## Chapter 9 - I write these things to warn you

These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be in
such a state; but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand,
that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you may rather attain
to a full assurance in Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all ages,
but was afterwards born of the Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man. He
also lived a holy life, and healed every kind of sickness and disease among the
people, and wrought signs and wonders for the benefit of men; and to those who
had fallen into the error of polytheism He made known the one and only God, His
Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the
Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the king. He
also died, and rose again, and ascended into the heavens to Him that sent Him,
and is sat down at His right hand, and shall come at the end of the world, with
His Father's glory, to judge the living and the dead, and to render to every one
according to his works. He who knows these things with a full assurance, and
believes them, is happy; even as ye are now the lovers of God and of Christ, in
the full assurance of our hope, from which may no one of you ever be turned
aside!

## Chapter 10 - My soul is for you

My soul is for you, and I rejoice greatly in your faith, and in your love, and
in your patience, and in your long-suffering. For I know that you are not puffed
up, but are humble, and that you are not ashamed to confess your faith in
Christ, but are ready to suffer for His name. I exhort you, therefore, to be of
one mind, and to be subject to the bishop, and to the presbytery, as to the
apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be
found in Him. It is meet also that the deacons, the ministers of the mysteries
of Jesus Christ, should in all things be pleasing to all. For they are not the
ministers of meat and drink, but of the Church of God. They are bound,
therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would do
fire.

## Chapter 11 - Thanks for their kindness

Thanks for their kindness. Ignatius asks them to send a deacon to Antioch to
congratulate the Church there on the restoration of peace.
