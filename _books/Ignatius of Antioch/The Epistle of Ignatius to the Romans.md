## Introduction

Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which has obtained mercy,
through the majesty of the Most High Father, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten
Son; the Church which is beloved and enlightened by the will of Him that willeth
all things which are according to the love of Jesus Christ our God; the Church
which also presides in the place of the region of the Romans, worthy of God,
worthy of honour, worthy of the highest happiness, worthy of praise, worthy of
obtaining her every desire, worthy of being deemed holy, and which presides over
love, is named from Christ, and possesses the law of the Father, and carries the
Father, whom I salute in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father: to
those who are united, both in flesh and spirit, to every one of His
commandments; who are filled inseparably with the grace of God, and are purified
from every foreign stain, I wish abundance of happiness unblameably, in Jesus
Christ our God.

## Chapter 1 - As a prisoner, I hope to see you

Forasmuch as I have heard of your godly love, which, according to the will of
God, you have attained, it will be to my advantage that I should be counted
worthy to behold your faces, and so receive a perfect joy. For since I am bound
in Christ Jesus, I have the more hope, if I am permitted to complete my journey,
that I may be found a disciple of my Lord, who did strengthen me. For I perceive
that you are full of God, and are desirous of my deliverance. I know your love,
and I know that you would fain save me. But I fear lest this very love of yours
should do me an injury; for it is not easy for you to attain to God, if you
spare me. But if you suffer me to be offered up as a sacrifice, you will be
found to be the friends of God. I am not commanding you, as Peter and Paul did.
They were apostles, and I am a condemned man; they were free, and I am a slave
even to this day. But if I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall
rise again free in Him. And now, being in bonds, I learn to desire nothing of
all that is seen, and of all that is unseen. For I am not afraid of the wild
beasts, but I welcome them; and I pray that they may be found eager to rush upon
me. And if they are unwilling, I will compel them. Come, fire and cross, and
grapplings with wild beasts, hewings and tearings, wrenching of bones, mangling
of limbs, crushing of my whole body, let the evil tortures of the devil come
upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.

## Chapter 2 - Do not hinder my martyrdom

I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts,
that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts,
that they may become my tomb, and may leave no trace of my body, so that when I
fall asleep, I may not be troublesome to any one. Then shall I be a true
disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world shall not see my body. Pray to Christ
for me, that by these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not,
as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They were apostles, and I am a
condemned man; they were free, and I am a slave even to this day. But if I
suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again free in Him. And
now, being in bonds, I learn to desire nothing of all that is seen, and of all
that is unseen. For I am not afraid of the wild beasts, but I welcome them; and
I pray that they may be found eager to rush upon me. And if they are unwilling,
I will compel them. Come, fire and cross, and grapplings with wild beasts,
hewings and tearings, wrenching of bones, mangling of limbs, crushing of my
whole body, let the evil tortures of the devil come upon me: only let me attain
to Jesus Christ.

## Chapter 3 - I am the wheat of God

I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts,
that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts,
that they may become my tomb, and may leave no trace of my body, so that when I
fall asleep, I may not be troublesome to any one. Then shall I be a true
disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world shall not see my body. Pray to Christ
for me, that by these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not,
as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They were apostles, and I am a
condemned man; they were free, and I am a slave even to this day. But if I
suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again free in Him. And
now, being in bonds, I learn to desire nothing of all that is seen, and of all
that is unseen. For I am not afraid of the wild beasts, but I welcome them; and
I pray that they may be found eager to rush upon me. And if they are unwilling,
I will compel them. Come, fire and cross, and grapplings with wild beasts,
hewings and tearings, wrenching of bones, mangling of limbs, crushing of my
whole body, let the evil tortures of the devil come upon me: only let me attain
to Jesus Christ.

## Chapter 4 - I am not worthy to be called a disciple

I am not worthy to be called a disciple, for I am not yet perfect. But I hope
that I shall be found worthy, if I attain to God. For I am not afraid of the
wild beasts, but I welcome them; and I pray that they may be found eager to rush
upon me. And if they are unwilling, I will compel them. Come, fire and cross,
and grapplings with wild beasts, hewings and tearings, wrenching of bones,
mangling of limbs, crushing of my whole body, let the evil tortures of the devil
come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.

## Chapter 5 - I am writing to you from Smyrna

I am writing to you from Smyrna, by the Ephesians, who are here with me, along
with many others, for the glory of God. They have refreshed me in every way, and
I pray that they may be refreshed by Jesus Christ. I salute all by name, and
especially the wife of Epitropus, with all her house, and her children. I salute
Attalus, my beloved, and all who are with him. I salute the Church of God which
is in Antioch of Syria, from whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last of
the faithful who are there, even as I have been thought worthy to be chosen to
show forth the honour of God. Farewell in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ,
our common hope.
