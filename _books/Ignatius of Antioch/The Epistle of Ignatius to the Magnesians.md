## Chapter 1 - Reason of writing the epistle

Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the [Church] blessed in the grace of
God the Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour, in whom I salute the Church which
is at Magnesia, near the Mæander, and wish it abundance of happiness in God the
Father, and in Jesus Christ, our Lord, in whom may you have abundance of
happiness.

HAVING been informed of your godly love, so well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly,
and determined to commune with you in the faith of Jesus Christ. For as one who
has been thought worthy of a divine and desirable name, in those bonds which I
bear about, I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the
flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, “who is the Saviour of all men, but specially
of them that believe;” by whose blood ye were redeemed; by whom ye have known
God, or rather have been known by Him; in whom enduring, ye shall escape all the
assaults of this world: for “He is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that which ye are able.”

## Chapter 2 - I rejoice in your messengers

Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most
worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and
through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy,
inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the
presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ, I determined to write to you.

## Chapter 3 - Honour your youthful bishop

It is therefore befitting that you should in no way be divided from your bishop,
but be subject also to the presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who
is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be found in Him. It is meet also that
the deacons, the ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in all
things be pleasing to all. For they are not the ministers of meat and drink, but
of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of
accusation against them, as they would do fire.

## Chapter 4 - Some wickedly act independently of the bishop

Let all, then, reverence the deacons as Jesus Christ, and the bishop as the
Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of God, and assembly of the
apostles. Apart from these there is no Church. Concerning all which I am
persuaded that ye are of the same mind. For I have received the manifestation of
your love, and have it with me in the person of your bishop. For his very
appearance is instructive, and his meekness is his power. Whom I imagine the
very ungodly must reverence, seeing they are also pleased that I do not spare
myself. For why should I, that I may be able to write to you of heavenly things?
But I fear lest I should do you an injury. For I am afraid of your love, lest it
should do me an injury. For it is easy for any one to think that he can, but it
is difficult for him to attain to God.

## Chapter 5 - Death is the fate of all such

For since there are two coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each
of them has its special character impressed upon it, so is it with the righteous
and the wicked. The one are of this world, but the other are of the world to
come. The unbelievers are of this world; but the believers, in love, have the
character of God the Father through Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in
readiness to die for His sake into His passion, His life is not in us.

## Chapter 6 - Preserve harmony

Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole
multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all things with
a divine harmony, while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your
presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your
deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus
Christ. He, being begotten by the Father before the beginning of time, was God
the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever; for “of His
kingdom there shall be no end,” says Daniel the prophet. Let us therefore love
one another, and be in harmony with each other; and let no one look upon his
neighbour after the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. Let there be nothing among you
that can divide you; but be ye united with your bishop, and those that preside
over you, for a type and evidence of your immortality.

## Chapter 7 - Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters

As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, “I can of
mine own self do nothing,” so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman,
do anything without the bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which
is destitute of his approval. For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to
the will of] God. Do ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God, as
unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the unbegotten God.

## Chapter 8 - Caution against false doctrines

Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are
unprofitable. For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge
that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to
Christ Jesus. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His
grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has
manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not
proceeding forth from silence, and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.

## Chapter 9 - Let us live with Christ

If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things have
come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but
living in the observance of the Lord’s Day, on which also our life has sprung up
again by Him and by His death—whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained
faith, and therefore endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ,
our only Master—how shall we be able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the
prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher? And
therefore He whom they rightly waited for, being come, raised them from the
dead.

## Chapter 10 - Beware of Judaizing

Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us
according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His
disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity. For
whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside,
therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the new
leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you
should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to
profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace Judaism,
but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth might be gathered
together to God.

## Chapter 11 - I write these things to warn you

These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be in
such a state; but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand,
that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that ye attain to full
assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place
in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly
accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, from which may no one of you ever
be turned aside.

## Chapter 12 - Ye are superior to me

May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am bound, I
am not worthy to be compared to any of you that are at liberty. I know that ye
are not puffed up, for ye have Jesus Christ in yourselves. And all the more when
I commend you, I know that ye cherish modesty of spirit; as it is written, “The
righteous man is his own accuser.”

## Chapter 13 - Be established in faith and unity

Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the
apostles, that so all things, whatsoever ye do, may prosper, both in the flesh
and spirit, in faith and love, with your most admirable bishop, and the
well-compacted spiritual crown of your presbytery, and the deacons who are
according to God. Be ye subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Christ to
the Father, that there may be a unity according to God among you.

## Chapter 14 - Your prayers requested

Knowing as I do that ye are full of God, I have but briefly exhorted you. Be
mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain to God; and of the Church which
is in Syria, whence I am not worthy to derive my name: for I stand in need of
your united prayer in God, and your love, that the Church which is in Syria may
be “deemed worthy of being refreshed by your Church.

## Chapter 15 - Salutations

The Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here for the
glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all things refreshed me, salute you,
along with Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrnaeans. The rest of the Churches, in
honour of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare ye well in the harmony of God, ye
who have obtained the inseparable Spirit, who is Jesus Christ.
